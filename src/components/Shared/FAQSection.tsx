    question: "What age groups do you teach?",
    answer: "We offer tailored coding lessons for children and teens aged 7 to 18, with curricula adjusted to suit different developmental stages and learning styles."
  },
  {
    question: "What do students learn in the free trial lesson?",
    answer: "The free trial is a personalized introductory session where your child will experience basic coding concepts through a fun, interactive activity, often using Scratch for younger learners. It's a great way to see if Bug to Byte is a good fit!"
  },
  {
    question: "What technical requirements are there for online classes?",
    answer: "Students will need a computer (Windows, macOS, or Chromebook), a stable internet connection, and a webcam/microphone. We'll provide any necessary software setup instructions before the class."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my child has no prior coding experience?",
    answer: "No problem at all! Our curriculum is designed for absolute beginners and progresses at a comfortable pace. We start with visual block coding to make learning intuitive."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your instructors qualified and background-checked?",
    answer: "Yes, all our instructors are experienced educators with a passion for coding and working with children. They undergo thorough background checks and continuous training to ensure a safe and effective learning environment."
